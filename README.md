# Swift Field Survey

A simple field survey application written in swift for iOS.

This is my first foray into iOS / Swift development so at the moment it is just a simple tool to capture 
an image and some locality information with that image. My plan is to implement a form for capturing some 
information about the image content and then to support online / offline syncing with a server which will
then serve up the locations via WFS and JSON, and the images via simple http requests (from a URL included in the
WFS layer attribute table).

Here are some screenshots of the simple beginnings of the app:
